# ABOUT
This project was done as part of FreeCodeCamp's challenge - https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine

A Random Quote Generator that fetches you random quotes when you click the "Randomize" button.
Developed on top of Google's Materialize Reponsive framework, this "Machine" looks just fine on all screens!
A simple code and very easy to customize! All you need is a "Key" to fetch random quotes from the server!

# HOW TO USE
You need to put your API key in the config file. See the config_example.js file for reference.

# DEVELOPER
